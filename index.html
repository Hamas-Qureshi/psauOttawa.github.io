              PSA UO - Mission

              To help students gain a higher perspective and knowledge on the culture of Pakistan by interacting through
              student-run events based at the University of Ottawa.

              - To carry on social and cultural activities.
              - To provide an opportunity for its members to learn and nurture the Pakistani language.

              - PSA would not enforce religious beliefs on any members in anyway.
              - PSA at uOttawa will operate in compliance with all relevant uOttawa policies.
              PSA UO - Mission

              PSA is a group at the University of Ottawa whose mandate is to promote social and cultural events in order
              to allow members to embrace the Pakistani tradition. The events we organize are mainly for the sheer
              enjoyment of the group members and include but are not limited to activities, formals, or social
              gatherings. The events we organize benefit the SFUO and the University of Ottawa by building a bridge
              between other SFUO clubs & associations by helping students interact with others and help gain a better
              knowledge on what the campus has to offer.

            <p> Hey, I'm Sauban, i'm a 3rd year of his undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering. Born in Karachi; raised Dubai. I moved to Canada in 2016 to finish the remaining years of high school and then pursue higher education. Even through my years in school in Dubai and Canada, I have always found ways to represent the Pakistani culture within the community. My ultimate goal is to demolish some stereotypes that people, unfortunately, have about the beautiful country that is Pakistan. When not in Ottawa, you will probably find me on Gerard Street in Toronto with a plate of Gol Gappay in one hand and Kashmiri chai in the other. </p>

            <p> Hello! My name is Moatter! I’m a third year student at UOttawa currently completing my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Science and working towards becoming a doctor! Despite being born and raised in Ottawa, I have always had a strong admiration for Pakistan and its rich culture, including the breathtaking landscapes and numerous tourist attractions. Being further away from Pakistan has drawn me even closer to it. As an executive member of PSA, I hope to show others too, how truly beautiful this country is and how much more it has to offer. I look forward to organizing events that not only stay true to the Pakistani culture but also welcome people of other ethnicities too. As someone who hopes for an even brighter and beautiful Pakistan, I also hope to diminish common misconceptions and show people “kai kitna khoobsurat hai hamara Pakistan”! </p>
